	abstract = {Research on screen content images (SCIs) becomes important as they are increasingly used in multi-device communication applications. In this paper, we present a study on perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs subjectively and objectively. We construct a large-scale screen image quality assessment database (SIQAD) consisting of 20 source and 980 distorted SCIs. In order to get the subjective quality scores and investigate, which part (text or picture) contributes more to the overall visual quality, the single stimulus methodology with 11 point numerical scale is employed to obtain three kinds of subjective scores corresponding to the entire, textual, and pictorial regions, respectively. According to the analysis of subjective data, we propose a weighting strategy to account for the correlation among these three kinds of subjective scores. Furthermore, we design an objective metric to measure the visual quality of distorted SCIs by considering the visual difference of textual and pictorial regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SCI perceptual quality assessment scheme, consisting of the objective metric and the weighting strategy, can achieve better performance than 11 state-of-the-art IQA methods. To the best of our knowledge, the SIQAD is the first large-scale database published for quality evaluation of SCIs, and this research is the first attempt to explore the perceptual quality assessment of distorted SCIs},

	abstract = {The recent popularity of remote desktop software and live streaming of composited video has given rise to a growing number of applications that make use of the so-called screen content images that contain a mixture of text, graphics, and photographic imagery. Automatic quality assessment (QA) of screen-content images is necessary to enable tasks, such as quality monitoring, parameter adaptation, and other optimizations. Although QA of natural images has been heavily researched over the last several decades, the QA of screen content images is a relatively new topic. In this paper, we present a QA algorithm called convolutional neural network-based screen content image quality estimator (CNN-SQE), which operates via a fuzzy classification of screen content images into plain-text, computer-graphics/cartoons, and natural-image regions. The first two classes are considered to contain synthetic content (text/graphics), and the latter two classes are considered to contain naturalistic content (graphics/photographs), where the overlap of the classes allows the computer graphics/cartoons segments to be analyzed by both text-based and natural-image-based features. We present a CNN-based approach for the classification, an edge-structure-based quality degradation model, and a region-size-adaptive quality-fusion strategy. As we will demonstrate, the proposed CNN-SQE algorithm can achieve better/competitive performance as compared with the other state-of-the-art QA algorithms.},

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

abstract = {Measurement of visual quality is of fundamental importance to numerous image and video processing applications. The goal of quality assessment (QA) research is to design algorithms that can automatically assess the quality of images or videos in a perceptually consistent manner. Traditionally, image QA algorithms interpret image quality as fidelity or similarity with a "reference" or "perfecft" image in some perceptual space. Such "full-referenc" QA methods attempt to achieve consistency in quality prediction by modeling salient physiological and psychovisual features of the human visual system (HVS), or by arbitrary signal fidelity criteria. In this paper, we approach the problem of image QA by proposing a novel information fidelity criterion that is based on natural scene statistics. QA systems are invariably involved with judging the visual quality of images and videos that are meant for "human consumption." Researchers have developed sophisticated models to capture the statistics of natural signals, that is, pictures and videos of the visual environment. Using these statistical models in an information-theoretic setting, we derive a novel QA algorithm that provides clear advantages over the traditional approaches. In particular, it is parameterless and outperforms current methods in our testing. We validate the performance of our algorithm with an extensive subjective study involving 779 images. We also show that, although our approach distinctly departs from traditional HVS-based methods, it is functionally similar to them under certain conditions, yet it outperforms them due to improved modeling. The code and the data from the subjective study are available at.},

abstract = {In this paper the problem of quality assessment of images containing various types of distortions is concerned. Many image quality metrics proposed during last decade are quite well correlated with human perception of various kinds of distortions with the assumption that only a single type of distortions is present in the image. One of the main reasons of such approach is the lack of datasets containing subjective quality assessment results of multiply distorted images. However, after the development of LIVE Multiply Distorted Image Quality Database, a new challenge related to verification of usability of known metrics as well as the development of new ones has appeared. In this paper, the results of such verification is presented not only for some well-known metrics but also for recently proposed combined metrics together with the proposed new combined metrics optimized for multiply distorted images. The new metrics outperform previously proposed ones in the aspect of linear correlation with subjective evaluations of images containing multiple distortions.

abstract = {The majority of existing objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are designed for evaluation of images corrupted by single distortion types. However, images may be degraded with multiple distortions during processing stages. In this paper, we propose a reduced-reference IQA algorithm to predict the quality of multiply-distorted images. An image is first decomposed into predicted and disorderly portions based on the internal generative mechanism theory. The structural information is captured from the predicted image by using a shearlet representation and R{\'{e}}nyi directional entropy is deployed to measure the disorderly information changes. Finally, we introduce the application of a framework namely Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) to build a quality model and obtain quality scores. During training, the LUPI framework utilizes a set of additional privileged data to learn an improved quality model. Experimental results on multiply-distorted image datasets (MLIVE and MDID2015) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed IQA model.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel image denoising strategy based on an enhanced sparse representation in transform domain. The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2-D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3-D data arrays which we call "groups." Collaborative filtering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3-D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3-D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3-D transformation. The result is a 3-D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},

It is common that images are simultaneously distorted by multiple types of distortions. Most existing objective image quality assessment (IQA) methods have been designed to estimate perceived quality of images corrupted by a single image processing stage. In this letter, we propose a no-reference (NR) IQA method to predict the visual quality of multiply-distorted images based on structural degradation. In the proposed method, a novel structural feature is extracted as the gradient-weighted histogram of local binary pattern (LBP) calculated on the gradient map (GWH-GLBP), which is effective to describe the complex degradation pattern introduced by multiple distortions. Extensive experiments conducted on two public multiply-distorted image databases have demonstrated that the proposed GWH-GLBP metric compares favorably with existing full-reference and NR IQA methods in terms of high accordance with human subjective ratings.},

	abstract = {Multiply-distorted images, that is, distorted by different types of distortions simultaneously, are so common in real applications. This kind of images contain multiple overlaying stages (e.g., acquisition, compression and transmission stage). Each stage will introduce a certain type of distortion, for example, sensor noise in acquisition stage and compression artifacts in compression stage. However, most current blind/no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods are specifically designed for singly-distorted images, thus resulting in their deficiency in handling multiply-distorted images. Motivated by the hypothesis that human visual system (HVS) is adapted to the structural information in images, we attempt to assess multiply-distorted images based on structural degradation. To this end, we use both first- and high-order image structures to design a novel referenceless quality metric for multiply-distorted images. Specifically, we leverage the quality-aware features extracted from both the gradient-magnitude map and contrast-normalized map, and further improve the performance by making use of redundancy of features with random subspace method. Experimental results on popular multiply-distorted image databases verify the outstanding performance of the proposed method.},

Local complementary structural information and a deep learning method are employed to blindly evaluate the quality of multiply distorted images. First, a monogenic signal representation is utilized to decompose a multiply distorted image into three complementary components: orientation, phase, and magnitude. The quality-predictive features are then determined from the complementary components. Finally, the features are mapped to the human quality score of the multiply distorted image based on the deep neural network. The results on two newly established multiply distorted image subjective databases confirm that our metric has a better prediction performance than existing state-of-the-art full-reference and classical blind metrics.},

	abstract = {Perceptual image quality assessment (IQA) plays an important role in numerous applications, including image restoration, compression, enhancement, and others. Although many works have been conducted on individually distorted IQA problems and have achieved encouraging results, few studies have been conducted on multiple distorted (MD) IQA problems. Thus, limited progress has been made. In this paper, we propose a novel no reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method, named improved multiscale local binary pattern (IMLBP), for addressing multiply distorted IQA problems. The image structures are sensitive to image distortions, which motivates us to utilize the structural characteristics for overall image quality prediction. We improved the local binary pattern (LBP) by considering the human visual mechanism to better extract the structural information. The IMLBP contains two parts, the LBP and the radius difference LBP (DLBP). The DLBP reflects the values' changes in the radial direction. Specifically, when the radius value is small, the proposed descriptor is computed to represent microstructural information. Conversely, it represents macrostructural information when the radius becomes large. Moreover, to better mimick the human visual mechanism, the IMLBP is computed with the multiscale strategy and the operation is based on a patch unit whose size is proportional to the radius value. The frequency histogram of feature maps is transformed to feature vectors. Subsequently, a predictable function trained by the support vector regression is used to infer the overall quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art IQA metrics on publicly available multiply distorted image databases. {\textcopyright} 1999-2012 IEEE.},
