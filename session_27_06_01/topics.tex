\section{The twelve balls puzzle}
We have twelve balls that are similar in shape. One of them weighs slightly different. The difference is so small, that only a special ballance scale can sense it. The thing is, we cannot use the scale more than three times. How to find the divergent ball? (Keep in mind that we don't know if the ball is lighter or heavier.)
